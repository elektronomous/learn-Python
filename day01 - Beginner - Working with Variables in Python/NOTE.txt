By the end of the day you will generate a band name generator. 

The whole reasons why we learning to program is to be able to tell the computer what it needs to do
and for it to follow our commands. our first line of commands:

    print()

now inside the parenthesis of the print command, iam going to tell it what's i want to print and it will be
output that to our console. 

    print("hello world");

the way that print() function works is super simple: you type the keyword print and inside the parenthesis 
you tell it what you're going to print. The reasons for the quotation marks inside the print() is that i can 
tell the computer that in between the quotation mark is not our code. This is called Strings, you can imagine
it as "a pearl necklace" where each pearl in the necklace you assign a character from "hello world".
