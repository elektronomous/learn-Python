"""
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by
them selves and 1.

You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed
in to it is prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is prime number because it's only divisible by them selves and 1.

but 4 is not prime number because it could be divisible by 1, 2, and 4.
